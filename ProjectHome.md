The goal is to provide a multi framework game engine for Haxe.
The main targets are JS / WebGL /Canvas. We just intend to prepare a framework that can offer all the tools for you to build a complete game website. We do also want to push HTML 5 limits.

In the end, we want to use only one code base to generate, the website, its content, its backup, its remoting system and provide the best Look and Feel.

This project uses HaXe, JavaScript, WebGL, Canvas, HTML5 ans CSS.

The focus is really to promote HaXe, HTML5 for games.

The project is killed for now, if you want to have Haxe+Opengl/webgl goodness, see github.com/motion-twin/h3d
